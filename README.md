## Features

#### 🕹️ Quick and Easy Setup - Add content and deploy.

Just install the theme, add content for each section, and deploy! This theme works seamlessly with hosts like Netlify.

#### 🧰 Predefined Sections - The building blocks for your portfolio.

Each section (e.g. About Me, Projects) is a standalone React component. You can add them to your portfolio as you like.

#### 📓 Content Integration - Effortless without any CMS.

You can add the content easily - either by passing the text as plain props or by pulling it from Markdown files in advance.

#### 💅 Responsive Design - With freshening animations.

The theme is designed with a mobile-first approach and looks perfect on small and large breakpoints. Moreover, it has some nice and smooth animations.

#### 🍪 [NEW] Cookie Consent Bar - Be ready for GDPR-compliant tracking.

Add tracking services like Google Analytics to your site and display a GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner.

#### 🌛 [NEW] Dark Mode - Based on user's preferences.

If the user's OS is set to using dark mode, the Gatsby Starter will automatically switch to a dark theme too.
